## This Website

The purpose of this site is to provide a public face for the work I do in the field of human and social science. Understanding human behavior often requires complex or unintuitive statistical methods, and I believe that it is my duty to do what I can to make such analyses transparent to the public. Too often critical information disappears from the public eye because the relationships explored are not well explained, and it is the responsibility of researchers to rectify this problem. Hopefully, this website serves to make the work I do more openly accessible to other researchers in this field, and to anyone else who is interested in understanding statistics and human behavior.
