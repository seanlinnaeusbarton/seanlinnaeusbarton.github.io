## Who I Am
I'm a doctoral candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Cognitive Science Department. I study human behavior in natural environments, specifically focusing on the complex relationship between the perceptual system and the motor system when completeing real-world tasks. I obtained my Masters Degree in Congnitive Science from RPI as well. I'm passionate about statistics and data analysis, and I believe in making data and research openly available and understandable. We live in an age where the most relevant issues facing us are complex and nuanced. I believe that researchers and scientists have an obligation not only to understand these issues, but also to present findings in a way that is meaningful and understandable to everyone.

## Current Work
My current research is focused on understanding how visual information in natural environments is used to guide and control walking. We often take for granted the complex interplay between our eyes and our legs when we walk down the street, but as the terrain becomes increasingly difficult (such as when hiking), this dynamic relationship is critical for success. I use motion capture and virtual reality to study how people walk over natural terrains that require precise foot placement, like those you would find on a hiking trail.

## Research Interests
More broadly, I am interested in statistics, data visualization, and human cognition and behavior. It's my belief that in order to understand why people make certain decision and take certain actions, we need to understand how human behavior is influenced by the structure of the information available in our world. These information/action relationships can be quantified as dynamic systems and understood through statistics. While this has important implications academically, I think that the world we currently live in can benefit from a scientific understanding of human behavior. My goal is to leverage my training as a cognitive scientist to address issues that are broadly applicable to society.
