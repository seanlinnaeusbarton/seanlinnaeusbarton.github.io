Hello! My name is Sean Barton and I'm a doctoral candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Cognitive Science Department. My current research is focused on understanding how visual information in natural environments is used to guide and control movement through those environments. I use motion capture and virtual reality to study how people walk over natural terrains that require precise foot placement, like those you would find on a hiking trail.

More broadly, I am interested in statistics, data visualization, and human cognition and behavior. It's my belief that in order to understand why people make certain decision and take certain actions, we need to understand how human behavior is influenced by the structure of the information available in our world. These information/action relationships can be quantified as dynamic systems and understood through statistics. While this has important implications academically, I think that the world we currently live in can benefit from a scientific understanding of human behavior. My goal is to leverage my training as a cognitive scientist to address issues that are broadly applicable to society.
